### Lights For Photo

1. Hard Light VS Soft Light

1. Light Modifiers
    1. Umbrellas:
        * White Umbrella - Shoot through umbrella
    1. Soft box

1. Three Point Light Setup
    * KEY/MAIN LIGHT at 45 degree
    * FILL LIGHT to cover rest of the area on the object covering shadow. The light should be only filling the shadow. To create depth, the light intestiy is kept 1/2 of main light.
    * ⁠BACK LIGHT - give special effect. Placed at main light opposite. Snoot to be applied at the back. Power equivalent to main light.
    > Note - The light should be kept at 45 angle from top such that light is above head of object. Distance of light from pbject should nt be more than 5 to 6 foot

1. General Camera Settings for Flash Photography In Room
    1. Single point focus
    2. ⁠ISO 100 because we have flash light
    3. SHUTTER = 1/125
    4. Range of APPERTURE 8 - 16
    5. ⁠White balance - 5000 to 5500K depending of light temperature
    6. ⁠Drive Mode = single shot
    7. Lense = ⁠85mm or more for Portrait (If focal length is less than in portrait there will be distortion)

1. *CURTAIN EFFECT* If speed of shutter is more than 1/125 than some part of the photo will be dark, as light and shutter speed will not match. To avoid this HSS high speed lights are used, where multiple flash are done to click one photo.

### Video

1. The Camera shutter speed needs to double of frame rate. e.g. shutter speed = 1/100 then grame rate 50 FPS. If we change this ratio than we will get different effects like blurr or choppy picture.
1. Ideal frame rate is 25 FPS at which our eyes work.
1. Preferred to place high intensity light in front of object and low intensity light behind the object to create depth of field.
