### Security

## Actions identified by OWASP(Open Web Application Security Project) to mitigate common web application risks

* Security considerations during the design phase are distinct from those that arise during implementation
* Secure SDLC creates balance of security and coding best practices. Typical practices include generating secuirty requirements, risk analysis, and penetrating testing.
* Questions to ASK:
* Q1. How to balance Confidentitality, Integrity, Availability?
    * Confidentitality may be prioritized when processing or storing sensitive data
    * Integrity may be prioritized when an application focuses on transactions
    * Availability may be prioritized when there are uptime SLAs
* Q2. How will you ensure auditability and access control? What types of logging and access contol checks might you need yo use?
* Q3. How will you navigate and document security trade-offs?
* Q4. What are aceptable risk to security?
* Q5. Who will have final say?
* Take Adv of Teamwork
    * Build consensus on how to work and what tools to use
    * Work with members who have application securityu expertise
    * Work with team to identify secure design patterns and tempelates.
* Incorporate Access Controls
* Limit Resource Consumption
* Avoid Application Assumptions
* Incorporate Plausibility Checks
